# MovieDB
**MOVIE INFO APP - SWIFTUI**

This app was built using SwiftUI and the TMDB Api. 
This is a simple app that allows users to see details and cast info about popular and newly released movies, as well as search for movies. 


**IF YOU WANT TO TRY THIS APP OUT:**
1. You will need a free api key from themoviedb.org.
2. Create a Constants.swift file in the cloned Xcode project.
3. Create these two constants in the file: 
       
        static let imageBaseUrl = "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original" 
        
        let apiKey = "YOUR API KEY HERE"
